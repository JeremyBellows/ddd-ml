### Machine Learning

- explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data
- focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data
- spam filtering, OCR, search engines, and computer vision

' Started in 50's, but abandoned and emerged back in 80's-90's
' Traditionally developers, when faced with a problem, develop and algorithm and write code. Certain classes of problems, however, do not lend themselves to this approach. With machine learning, the developer instead supplies relevant data to the machine and allows the computer to create the appropriate algorithm.
' Supervised learning is the branch of machine learning that deals primarily with prediction. Given examples, supervised learning algorithms create models that generalize the decision making process. In essence, the machine learns from the past in order to accurately predict the future.
' Unsupervised learning is the branch of machine learning that strives to understand the structure of data. This data, unlike supervised learning, does not have a predefined outcome that requires prediction but is vast enough to require a principled approach to either visual or physical compression.
